# Classification-of-Breast-Thermograms

Breast Thermograms from the DMR-IR dataset were used to train the model and predict the results. Different Convolutional Neural Networks were trained and tested with the data extracted fromt the DMR-IR dataset which can be found at http://visual.ic.uff.br/dmi/. The results obtained were on par with the existing breast cancer diagnosis models.
